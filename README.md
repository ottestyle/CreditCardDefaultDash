# CreditCardDefaultDash
A Dash app that displays the results based on my analysis of using ML on the dataset "default of credit card clients" found on Kaggle. 

The purpose of this project is to brush-up on machine learning theory, become familiarized with building a web application in Python and deploy it using PythonAnyWhere.

The interest for the dataset originates from my current role, as I work for a debt collection agency and I think it is interesting to assess reasoning for why people default on their credit card. 

The app is not yet finished. Still need to write code for the models used and also incorporate other models in the app (16/02/2025).
