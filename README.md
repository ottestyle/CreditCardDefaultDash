# CreditCardDefaultDash
A Dash app that displays the results based on my analysis of using ML on the dataset "default of credit card clients" found on Kaggle. 

The purpose of this project is to brush-up on machine learning theory and become familiarized with building a web application in Python.

The interest for the dataset originates from my current role, as I work for a debt collection agency and I think it is interesting to understand factors for why people default on their credit card.
